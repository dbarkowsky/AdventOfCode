# Advent of Code 2023

[See 2023's challenges.](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

## Personal Commentary

Second year of AoC. I decided to try C# this year. I think it would be a neat challenge to do every year in a different language, but also there's a project at work that uses ASP.NET, and it would be nice to sharpen up my C# for that.

## Instructions

You'll need `dotnet` installed first. I used 7.0.401 while doing this, but I expect any recent version to work.

In the AdventOfCode2023 folder, use `dotnet run <number of day>` to run the project. This may change as the month goes on...
