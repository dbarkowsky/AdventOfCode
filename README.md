# Advent of Code

## What is AoC?

[The website](https://adventofcode.com/) explains it best:

> Advent of Code is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
>
> You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## My Solutions

Each year has its own folder that contains solutions and instructions on how to run them. The answers in the README files are specific to my input, so if you're doing your own challenge, you'll need to provide your own input.

I'm trying to do each year in a different language.

So far:

- 2015: Swift (Ongoing)
- 2022: JavaScript
- 2023: C# (Ongoing)

Languages I would still like to try for other years:

- Python
- Go
- Mojo
- C++
- TypeScript
- Perl
- Java
- Rust
- Kotlin
- Powershell
- Bash
