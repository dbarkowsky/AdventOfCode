# Advent of Code 2022

[See 2022's challenges.](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

## Personal Commentary

This was my first year participating. I really enjoyed the puzzles, and I'll be looking to go back and complete previous years.

I managed to keep to the pace of one puzzle per day on the day it was released until exams and holiday obligations took precedence. There were definitely a few later challenges that took a lot more time than I expected.

Most of these were done without any aids, but there are a handful that I had to seek a little help on. If I used any other solutions as a basis, I've noted that in the file. It's amazing that people were solving these within the first hour up to the end.

I chose to do this year in JavaScript. It's probably my most familiar language at this point, and this showed me some tricks that I didn't know beforehand. I'll be brushing up on my algorithms for sure. I think a different language every year would be interesting, but maybe just for the previous years.

## Instructions

If you want to actually run any of these, you'll need to install Node. From there, clone the repository and use `npm start` to run the `aoc2022.js` file from the root directory. That file contains a function for each day. Simply call the function you want at the bottom of the file. There's also a USE_TEST_DATA boolean at the bottom if you'd rather run the test data shown in the README files.
